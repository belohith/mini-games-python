**Performance & Responsiveness:**
Please note that these are simple projects running in a web environment.
Complex animations or highly interactive elements (like the Aim Trainer game we discussed)
might not feel as smooth or responsive as a native desktop application.
This is a limitation of web frameworks designed for data applications.

While Streamlit aims for broad browser compatibility, optimal performance and visual fidelity
may vary slightly across different web browsers and devices.
